                <p>I am Gemma Goddard, a current junior at <a href="https://tamu.edu" target=”_blank”>Texas A&M
                        University</a>, expecting to graduate in December 2024. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in
                    Computer Science with an emphasis in Psychology. Additionally, I am on the Texas A&M cross country
                    and track and field team- view <a

                        target=”_blank”>the team roster</a>. My time as a student-athlete has taught me the importance
                    of effective communication, how to work with a team to achieve a common goal, and time management
                    skills. It has been a challenging endeavor, but I am proud of the skills and perseverance that it
                    has taught me. I am also a <a

                        target=”_blank”>computer science peer teacher</a> at Texas A&M University- where I assist other
                    students debug their code and understand complex coding concepts. This position has helped me better
                    understand the content learned in previous classes and improve my communication skills. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Despite managing a rigorous course load and a busy practice schedule, I also launched and operate a
                    Christian small business called <a href="https://he-beforeme.com/" target=”_blank”>He Before Me</a>-
                    you can read more about my business's website under the projects tab above. Launching my business
                    has sparked my interest in developing websites, and I am seeking to explore this field and gain
                    experience. In the summer of 2023, I further explored this interest by completing the <a

                        target=”_blank”>Google UX Design Certification Program</a>, in which I learned to understand and
                    empathize with user needs, develop mockups, wireframes, and prototypes, and conduct research on the
                    feasibility of my designs. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I am also a huddle leader for <a href="https://www.fca.org/" target=”_blank”> FCA (Fellowship of
                        Christian Athletes)</a> at A&M University. The mission of FCA is to "see every coach and athlete
                    enter into a growing relationship with Jesus Christ and His church." My role as an FCA leader
                    entails planning and leading small group discussions for our Monday night meeting, facilitating
                    guest speakers, and organizing fellowship nights. My time in the organization has been super
                    impactful and built leadership and communication skills.</p>
